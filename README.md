# Lagrange Interpolator

A Python script that calculates the exact polynomial passing through a set of points (x, y) using Lagrange Interpolation.

## Features
- Uses `sympy` for exact fractional output (no rounding errors).
- Dynamic input for any number of points.
- Returns unsimplified, simplified, and combined fraction forms.

## Setup
Requires Python 3. Install the dependency:
pip install sympy

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   python lagrange.py
2. Enter points as "x y" (e.g., "0 1").
3. Type "s" to finish and generate the polynomial.
